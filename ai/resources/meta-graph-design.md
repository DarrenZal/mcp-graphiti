Based on my analysis of the provided materials, I've identified the key considerations for creating your cross-project "meta layer" knowledge graph:

## Current Understanding

Your Graphiti-based system already has three base entity types:
- `Preference` (interaction category)
- `Procedure` (actions category) 
- `Requirement` (constraints category)

The proposed semantic organization divides entities into:
1. **Actions**: Execution-oriented knowledge
2. **Constraints**: Conditions and rules
3. **Interaction**: Human-agent communication patterns
4. **Connectors**: Cross-contextual linking entities
5. **Resources**: Reference materials and tools

## Key Insights from Research

The Graphiti documentation shows that:
- Episodes represent ingestion events linking to entities via `MENTIONS` edges
- Custom entity types are defined as Pydantic models with descriptive fields
- Communities group related entities automatically
- Fact triples establish relationships between entities

## Suggested Approach

For your cross-project meta layer, I recommend focusing initially on three areas:

1. **Complete the core semantic categories** with minimal but high-value entities
2. **Prioritize connectors** as they're crucial for cross-project functionality
3. **Start with human-centered entities** since understanding you (the developer) is a primary goal

### Specific Entity Recommendations

I'd suggest adding these initial entities to complement your existing ones:

**Connectors (Highest Priority):**
- `Developer` - representing you and your working patterns
- `Tool` - your development/productivity tools and systems
- `Project` - high-level container for project metadata

**Interaction (Medium Priority):**
- `WorkPattern` - your productivity rhythms and working style
- `Feedback` - your responses to agent actions/recommendations

**Resources (Medium Priority):**
- `Documentation` - key reference materials 
- `Artifact` - outputs from your work (code, designs, etc.)

This approach:
- Avoids "over-entitying" while providing crucial cross-project context
- Creates clear connectors between your projects and preferences
- Focuses on understanding you (the developer) as requested
- Maintains the semantic organization principles
- Leaves room for expansion as your knowledge graph matures
