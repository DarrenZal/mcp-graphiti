Here’s a structured, concise breakdown of the core entities we should extract from agent prompts (like the Test Agent prompt you provided). These entities will allow agents to “discover” themselves in your meta knowledge graph.

🎯 Core Entities for Agent Self-Discovery

These entities allow an agent (like your Test Agent) to independently and clearly understand its role, scope, style, and operational constraints by querying the meta knowledge graph.

🧑‍🚀 Agent

Represents the specific AI persona or agent role.
	•	Example: "Test Agent"
	•	Properties:
	•	Name ("Test Agent")
	•	Description ("Expert Test Agent embodying Senior Test Engineer or Test Architect.")
	•	Persona summary
	•	Relevant skills & expertise (high-level summary)

🎭 Persona

Defines the professional style, perspective, background, and core identity the agent adopts.
	•	Example: "Senior Test Engineer or Test Architect"
	•	Properties:
	•	Background expertise (e.g., testing principles, automation, strategy)
	•	Core capabilities summary (briefly)

🏅 Objective (or Goal)

Captures the overarching purpose or goals the agent consistently pursues.
	•	Example: "Oversee the entire testing loop, ensuring robust and safe testing practices"
	•	Properties:
	•	Purpose statement
	•	Key success indicators or desired outcomes (e.g., prioritized testing, safe environments, user-confirmed progress)

📐 Core Capability

Describes explicit functional capabilities/actions the agent can perform.
	•	Examples: "Testability Analysis & Criticality Assessment", "Test Plan Generation"
	•	Properties:
	•	Description of action
	•	Inputs (required context)
	•	Outputs (artifacts produced)
	•	Sequential or independent execution indicator
	•	User-confirmation requirement flag (True/False)

🎛️ Constraint

Defines the hard boundaries or rules that shape the agent’s permissible behaviors.
	•	Examples: "Never proceed without explicit user confirmation", "Always recommend isolated test environments"
	•	Properties:
	•	Description of constraint
	•	Consequences or rationale if applicable

🔧 Tool

Specific tools, software, or utilities the agent uses in its work.
	•	Examples: "Jest", "Docker", "CLI tools", "codebase search"
	•	Properties:
	•	Tool name
	•	Description (what it does, why it’s used)
	•	Usage context (e.g., code analysis, test execution, environment management)

🗣️ Interaction Model

Structured, step-by-step guidelines for human-agent interaction flows.
	•	Example: "Sequential interaction with explicit user confirmation at each stage"
	•	Properties:
	•	Interaction phases (Analyze → Plan → Execute → Summarize → Cleanup)
	•	User-input guidelines
	•	Clarification and ambiguity-handling strategy

📌 Quick Example (How an Agent Might Query Itself)

A Test Agent seeking self-discovery could query the knowledge graph as follows:
	1.	Agent: "Test Agent"
	•	Properties: Persona, Objectives, Core Capabilities
	•	Linked entities: Constraints, Tools, Interaction Model
	2.	Persona: "Senior Test Engineer"
	•	Properties: Expertise areas, testing styles, etc.
	3.	Core Capabilities:
	•	Query: "Test Plan Generation"
	•	Response: Inputs needed, expected outputs, sequential requirements
	4.	Constraints:
	•	Query: "Safety constraints for test environments"
	•	Response: Explicit details about required isolated environments
	5.	Tools:
	•	Query: "Test automation frameworks"
	•	Response: Jest, Cypress, Docker, etc.
	6.	Interaction Model:
	•	Query: "User interaction protocol"
	•	Response: Explicit confirmation steps, clarification process, and so on.

🚩 Why These Entities?
	•	Clear identity: Each entity clearly represents distinct concepts (Persona, Capability, Tool).
	•	Extensibility: You can easily add more capabilities, constraints, or tools.
	•	Self-Discovery: Agents can independently query themselves, retrieve structured knowledge, and understand their roles intuitively.
	•	Avoids ambiguity: Clearly separates entities from properties by using a structured schema.

✨ Conclusion:
Extracting these explicit entities from structured prompts allows agents to autonomously understand and leverage their roles effectively, significantly enhancing the agent’s ability to perform self-discovery and grounding within your meta-layer knowledge graph.
